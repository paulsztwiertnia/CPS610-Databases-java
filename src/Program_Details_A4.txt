SELECT * FROM A4_Table;
SELECT * FROM Lock_Table;

The connection details are near the top, switch it to whatever you need. The user/pass need to be in an input.txt file in the same directory.

The input to the program is in the format of:
"W(1,2);R(2);C R(5);W(3,3);C "
Where each action is split by a semi-colon, and transactions are split by spaces. Make sure to have a "C"/commit at the end of each transaction or you'll get locks left in the lock_table that you'll have to manually delete.
Use all capitals. I didn't account for user error.
It'll be stored in an arraylist of the following format:
transactions = [ [[W,1,2],[R,2],[C]], [[R,5],[W,3,3],[C]] ]
i.e. list of action details inside of a list of the actions inside of a list of transactions

For the most part, we check the lock_table for existing locks, then make a new lock or modify them as needed.
Waiting is done if a lock that can't be touched is there.
As each action is done, the action letter gets changed to "D" so that the switch in the loop doesn't do anything (goes to next action instead).

Program runs round-robin style.
